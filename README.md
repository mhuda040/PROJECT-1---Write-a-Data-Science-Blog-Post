<H3>Project Motivation</H3>

<P>For this project, I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a dataset of Netflix Movies and TV Shows found on Kaggle.  This dataset was compiled by Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine.  As of April 7, 2021, the dataset contains 7787 listings spanning 12 columns.<?P>

<P>This project focuses on answering the following questions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>What are the Top 10 countries where those Movies and TV Shows were filmed?</LI>
<LI>What year were the majority of listings in the Netflix dataset from?</LI>
<LI>What are the categories for Movies and TV Shows in the Netflix dataset?</LI>
<LI>How many Movies and TV Shows were added to Netflix each year?</LI>
<LI>What is the Ratings Distribution for the Movies and TV Shows in our Netflix dataset?</LI>
</UL>

<P>The following libraries were used in our Jupyter Notebook.  Code was programmed in Python 3.</P>
